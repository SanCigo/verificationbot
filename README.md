## About
### Background
VerificationBot started as a small project for the UVic Engineering and Computer Science Discord server due to a growing server population. We wanted to make an automated system to prevent non-UVic students from accessing the remainder of the Discord server. With this goal in mind, and with the help of [MiningMark48](https://github.com/miningmark48), the initial draft of the bot was created.

Since its initial creation, the bot has been an excellent method for keeping non-UVic students from accessing our Discord server. With our goal accomplished, other servers began to take notice. Thanks to the Fall 2020 semester being fully online due to the pandemic, many more Discord servers were being created, some with thousands of members. With these numerous servers, a lack of a verification system was becoming a concern. 

From this point, the bot was rewritten; going from a single-file bot to a multiple-file, fully modularized machine. What once wasn't possible, the bot was now able to be controlled better than before, thanks to the use of a [config](./docker-compose.yml).

### How Does it Work?
When users join a Discord server, they are given access to limited channels, one of which allows them to send in their university or institutional email with the help of a bot command.

`!email example@example.com`

Once they run the command and if the email is valid (matches the set domain), they will receive an email containing a 4-digit code. The user then takes this code back to the Discord server and runs a command with this code.

`!verify 1234`

If the code is valid, they will be given a role, allowing access to the rest of the server (or however configured).

# Setup
## Docker
**Recommended Method**
1. To start, verify Docker is installed. If it is not or you don't know, go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to download Docker. Docker-compose is now included with Docker.

2. Download the source code, extract to a desired directory and browse to the `docker_compose.yml`. Open it with notepad or your text editor of choice and add your environmental variables (token, key, domain, etc.).

3. A bot token needs to be created to run this bot. You can find the Discord Developers Portal [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). If you need help making a bot account, [Google](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+make+a+discord+bot) is your friend.

	When adding your bot to your server, **make sure the bot has the necessary permissions or things will almost certainly break!**

	Permissions **required**:
	- Manage Server
	- Manage Roles
	- View Channels
	- Send Messages
	- Manage Messages
	- Read Message History
	- Add Reactions

4. Open a command prompt or terminal, move to the directory containing the downloaded `docker-compose.yml` file, and run the following commands:
	```bash
 	docker compose build
	docker compose up -d
	```

5. Congratulations! Assuming your variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file are correct and everything is installed correctly you should have a running Discord bot!

## Python Virtual Environment
1. To start, download this repo. Also, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

2. Create a virtual environment with the following command:
	```bash
	python -m venv venv
	```

3. Activate the virtual environment with one of the following commands:
	```bash
	.\venv\Scripts\activate
	```
	or
	```bash
	activate venv
	```

4. Install dependencies found in `requirements.txt`:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

5. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the downloaded repo. In this file, set your environmental variables as specified in `docker-compose.yml`.

6. Finally, run `bot.py`:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

7. Congratulations! Assuming all went well and everything is installed correctly you should have a running Discord bot!

## Command Notes
### Email
There are a variety of extra handlers to help aid people that can't quite follow the instructions properly. The email command will accept the following variations:
- (!) email [email@email.com]  - extra space before 'email'
- (!)[email@email.com]  - no 'email'
- (!)email[email@email.com]  - missing space between 'email' and their email
- [email@email.com]  - missing alias and 'email'
- email [email@email.com]  - missing alias

These are primarily there to assist people new to Discord or who can't follow instructions. The *vhelp* command encourages use of the proper form, \<alias>email [email@email.com].

**Future Updates**

Although this repo is being given support and updates, it is limited. If [Discord](https://discord.com/) or [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) make any sudden changes to their API, do not expect an immediate update. 

Major security patches and API changes may result in an update, or may result in support being dropped. If support is dropped indefinitely, this file will be updated to note that the bot is now deprecated and the repo will be archived and set to read-only. At the moment, this is unlikely and not in the forseeable future.
